# Music Genre Classification

This project implements a music genre classification system using a neural network. The system is built with PyTorch and Keras and utilizes audio feature extraction to classify music into different genres.

## Project Structure

The project includes the following main functions:

- **load_data**: Load and prepare the dataset from a CSV file.
- **preprocess_data**: Normalize features and encode labels.
- **split_data**: Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
- **create_model**: Build the neural network model.
- **train_and_evaluate**: Train the model and evaluate its performance.
- **extract_features**: Extract audio features from an audio file.
- **preprocess_and_predict**: Preprocess audio file and predict its genre.
- **load_and_evaluate_individual**: Load the trained model and evaluate individual audio files.
