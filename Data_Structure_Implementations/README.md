# Data Structure Implementations

## Overview
This directory contains various data structure implementations, showcasing proficiency in both Java and C programming languages. Each subdirectory is dedicated to a specific data structure and includes source code, comprehensive documentation, and test cases.

### Subdirectories
- **BST_Implementation**: A Java implementation of a Binary Search Tree (BST), a fundamental data structure in computer science.
- **LinkedList_Implementation_C**: An implementation of a circular doubly linked list in C.
- **LinkedList_Implementation_Java**: A custom Java implementation of a LinkedList, demonstrating the use of a doubly linked list.
- **Vector_Implementation**: A custom implementation of a Vector (similar to an ArrayList) in Java.

Each subdirectory contains detailed information about the specific data structure, including its features, usage examples, and test cases.

## Features
- **Diverse Data Structures**: Includes implementations of trees, linked lists, and dynamic arrays.
- **Language Proficiency**: Demonstrates skills in Java and C.
- **Testing and Documentation**: Each implementation is accompanied by thorough documentation and test cases.
- **Generic Implementations**: Where applicable, data structures are implemented generically to handle various data types.

## Usage
