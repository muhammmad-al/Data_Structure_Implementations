# Seam Carving Image Processing

## Problem Description
Seam carving is a content-aware image resizing technique. The goal is to resize an image while preserving its important features and content. Traditional resizing methods can lead to distortion or loss of important information, while seam carving analyzes the image to identify and remove the least significant seams (connected paths of pixels). This results in a more visually pleasing and context-aware resizing.

## Approach / Solution
In this project, I have implemented the Seam Carving algorithm in Java. Here's an overview of the approach and solution:

1. **Energy Map Calculation**: We start by calculating the energy map of the input image. The energy of each pixel represents its importance in the image, and it's computed based on color differences between neighboring pixels. A higher energy value indicates a more important pixel.

2. **Dynamic Programming**: We use dynamic programming to find the optimal seam (path of pixels) with the lowest energy from the top to the bottom of the image. This is done by iteratively calculating the minimum energy path for each pixel in the image.

3. **Seam Identification**: Once we have the dynamic programming matrix, we identify the seam with the minimum total energy, starting from the top row. This gives us the path that should be removed from the image.

4. **Seam Removal**: We remove the identified seam from the image by shifting the pixels to the left or right, depending on the seam's position. This effectively resizes the image while preserving its content.

5. **Iterative Carving**: If further resizing is needed, we can repeat the process iteratively by recomputing the energy map and finding the next seam to remove. This allows for precise control over the image's size.

### Output Information

Upon running the Seam Carving algorithm, you will encounter the following information and visual feedback:

1. **Seam Weight:**
   - The algorithm calculates and displays the weight of the seam. This weight represents the importance of the seam within the image.

2. **Seam Coordinates:**
   - You will see the x-coordinates (column numbers) of each pixel in the identified seam. This information helps you visualize the path of the seam.

3. **Processing Time:**
   - The algorithm measures and reports the time taken for the seam carving process. This can be useful for assessing performance.

### Visual Result

The algorithm offers a graphical representation of the seam carving results:

- A graphical window opens, displaying the input image with the identified seam highlighted in red. This visual feedback allows you to observe how the image has been resized while preserving important content.

### Iterative Carving (Optional)

For advanced usage, the algorithm supports iterative carving:

- You can customize the code to run seam carving iteratively. This enables you to resize the image multiple times by removing additional seams. Useful for fine-tuning image dimensions.

### Customization and Experimentation

The algorithm is designed to be customizable and experimental-friendly:

- Change the input image path by updating the `imgfilename` variable in the `Main.java` file.
- Adjust the number of seams to remove to achieve your desired image size.
- Experiment with different energy calculation methods or algorithms to potentially optimize the results.

## Efficiency of the Solution
The efficiency of this Seam Carving solution depends on several factors:

- **Time Complexity**: The time complexity of this implementation is approximately O(w * h^2), where 'w' is the width of the image and 'h' is the height. It involves the calculation of the energy map and dynamic programming matrix. The iterative carving process can add more time if multiple seams are removed.

- **Memory Usage**: The memory usage depends on the size of the image and the storage of the energy map and dynamic programming matrix. It's typically O(w * h) for the image and O(w * h) for the energy map and dynamic programming matrix.

- **Parallelization**: Depending on the requirements, you can explore parallelization techniques to speed up the computation of the energy map and dynamic programming matrix, making the solution more efficient.
