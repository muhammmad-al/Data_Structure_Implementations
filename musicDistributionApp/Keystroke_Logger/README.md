# Keystroke Logger

This project implements a simple keystroke logger using Python and the `pynput` library. It logs all keystrokes to a file named `keystrokes_log.txt` with timestamps.

## Notes

- This keystroke logger is for educational purposes only. Do not use it for malicious purposes.
- Ensure you have permission to log keystrokes on any machine you use this script on.
