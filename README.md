# Muhammad's Tech Portfolio ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my tech portfolio! This repository showcases six diverse projects that demonstrate my expertise in machine learning, blockchain, cryptocurrency, decentralized applications, and full-stack development. Below, you'll find direct demo links and descriptions for each project.

## Project Demos

1. Full-Stack Decentralized NFT Auction Platform: Link - https://nameless-castle-94869-6cdd3e0d35fe.herokuapp.com/
   
2. Music Distribution Mobile Application: Video Demo - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yz3bGXdSrzQ&feature=youtu.be 

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
